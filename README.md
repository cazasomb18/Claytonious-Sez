Scintillating Sequences
A memory game involving repeating a sequence of lights and patterns with key strokes.

Project One Title - “SCINTILLATING SEQUENCES”

MVPs

1.) Have user screen where both users can input their names and then select start:, user names will be displayed throughout the game with a column displaying each user’s score.
2.) Keys arrow keys correspond to light up pattern pattern displayed on screen by application.
3.) Rounds scored and displayed at the end of each round.
4.) Msgs displayed when you get a pattern right - program also yells at you when you make an incorrect keystroke.
5.) Listeners/handlers for arrow keys also queue corresponding sounds.

USER STORIES - users should be able to…

 - Read the game prompts at the start of each round in order to know how to play.
 - Insert their name and start game when button clicked.
 - Have arrow keys light up sounds when pressed in order to replicate displayed pattern.
 - Know when they get a pattern correct or incorrect via program “shaming” you or “praising” you.
 - Users take turns trying to replicate different patterns and compare their scores at the end of each round.

Nice to Have

1.) Animate flashing buttons when pressed.
2.) Have pattern increase in length (number of key presses required) after each round.
3.) Have pattern increase in speed and the end of each round.
4.) Have a timeout limit that end round if user fails to replicate pattern.

Stretches

1.) Have pattern repeat when you press a wrong key and repeat rest of pattern past that point.
2.) Have different game modes: Easy, Normal, Hard.
3.) ‘SHAME’ found fx w/ bell emitted when users input wrong pattern.
